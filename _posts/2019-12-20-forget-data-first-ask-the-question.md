### Introduction

I see a race. A race to collect hordes of data of different shapes and sizes. I see the data science society, fragmented into groups. The (*business*) stakeholders are oblivious of the question they want to solve. Their ideology is, "*as long as data is being collected, we are doing good*". The technical group in the business are oblivious of proper data governance practices. They think by maintaining the traditional relational data repositories (*SQL*) and the database system design document (DSDD), they are good to go.
