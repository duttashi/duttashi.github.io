title: About Me

---

My name is Ashish Dutt.

As the tag line suggests, this blog primarily focusses on data analytical activities. I chose to create this blog so as to keep readers with similar interest updated of my research work. The technical aspects of my research work as well my continued tryst with data analysis will be updated here.

<b>Current association</b>: 

With a blended work experience of over a decade in teaching and educational technologies. my research interest is in the soft set theory and its applicability in data clustering. I am a data analyst by profession and a PhD candidate by interest in the Department of Information Systems, University of Malaya (UM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

Subject matter of the posts on this blog typically deals with my day-to-day encounters with mathematical or scientific ideas that I find beautiful, valuable, interesting, amusing, or (less often) infuriating. I benefit much from online sources – hence, I’d like to return something to the community by posting tutorials and code-snippets on this platform.
