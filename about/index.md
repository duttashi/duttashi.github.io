title: About Me

---

I am fond of **Data Science** and a **R, Python, SQL** enthusiast.
You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/duttashi), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4195053/ashish). Tweet me at [@duttashish_](https://twitter.com/duttashish_) 

**Current work**

I'm interested in unsupervised and supervised algorithms, applicable to mixed data. For my phd, a novel partition-based feature selection approach for mixed data clustering was proposed. I completed research and wrote my thesis at the Department of Information Systems, [University of Malaya](https://www.um.edu.my/), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. My research was funded by [iGRAS](https://ips.um.edu.my/services/finance/scholarship). 

I also contribute to R.
